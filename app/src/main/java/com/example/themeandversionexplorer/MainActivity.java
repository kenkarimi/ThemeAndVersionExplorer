/*Difference between Action Bar & Toolbar:
 * ACTION BAR: The element present at the top of the activity screen. It is a salient feature of an android application that has a consistent presence over ALL its activities.
 * It provides a visual structure to the app and contains some of the frequently used elements for the users. All applications that use the default theme provided by the Android(Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight.DarkActionBar),
 * contains an ActionBar by default. However, developers can customize it in several ways depending upon their needs. Components that can be included in the ActionBar are:
 * App Icon, Navigation drawer, Title and Subtitle, Action button, Action overflow menu(three dots)
 * TOOLBAR: Basically the advanced successor of the ActionBar. It is much more flexible and customizable in terms of appearance and functionality.
 * Unlike ActionBar, its position is not hardcoded i.e., not at the top of an activity. Developers can place it anywhere in the activity according to the need just like any other View in android.
 * Toolbar uses material design theme features of Android and thus provides it backward compatibility up to API 7(Android 2.1). Features supported by the Toolbar are much more focused and customizable than the ActionBar.
 * Following are the components that can be added to a Toolbar: App Icon, Navigation drawer, Title and Subtitle, ActionMenu items, Multiple custom views such as TextView, ImageView, etc.
