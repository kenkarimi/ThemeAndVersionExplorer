    <!-- NB: Even if a drawable is used to override a theme, it seems we're still unable to override the default underline color.
        What instead happens is you have two different colors on top of each other at the bottom no matter how much we thicken the stroke of the drawable underline.
        Conclusion: The drawable is best suited to customizing how the edit text looks not necessarily overriding themes.
